# Data Structures
Implementation of [`Data Structures`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) and some of their theory (overview, ideas, their structures, [`interfaces`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)), [`asymptotic analysis`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis#:~:text=In%20mathematical%20analysis%2C%20asymptotic%20analysis,as%20n%20becomes%20very%20large.) etc).

## Motivation
The idea is to deeply understand why each data structure was invented, intricacies of their work, mathematical foundations of them and, of course, their implementations.
